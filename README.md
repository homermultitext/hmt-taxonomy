# taxonomy

This repository is for notes trying to inventory and illustrate at least one example of every kind of content we have encountered in HMT manuscripts.

For now, we're starting with this simple, single page, with types of content grouped by manuscript.

Intentionally omitted from these lists:  *Iliad* text and *scholia*.  (Those are why we chose the MSS:  we know they're going to be there).

Our main goals are:

1.  trying to get as complete a list as possible for the Venetus A since we have now (nearly) complete editions of *Iliad* and *scholia*.  What else did we see?
2.  keeping track of content we encounter *as we edit* in Venetus B and Upsilon 1.1.
